Decoder-Ring is a versatile project that empowers you to encode or decode messages using three distinct ciphers: the Caesar Shift cipher, the Polybius Square cipher, and the Substitution Cipher cipher.

## Usage 

1. Choose the desired cipher from the available options.
2. Input the text you want to encode or decode.
3. Set the appropriate parameters, such as the shift value for the Caesar Shift cipher or the substitution key for the Substitution Cipher cipher.
4. Click the "Encode" or "Decode" button to generate the transformed text.

## Ciphers

### Caesar Shift Cipher

The Caesar Shift cipher involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

### Polybius Square Cipher

The Polybius Square cipher replaces each letter with a pair of numbers representing its row and column in a predefined grid.

### Substitution Cipher

The Substitution Cipher cipher replaces each letter in the plaintext with another letter based on a substitution key.
